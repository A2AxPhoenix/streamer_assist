Welcome to Streamer Assist V.0.0.1. This is a work-in-progress build that I have been
wanting to work on for a while and finally have something resembling working code that
I am happy to share. This program is to help automate some information that streamers
might want to help make informed decisions on how to make their streams better, assist
streamers by automating the giveaway process by using intelligent database making, and 
will one day be a one stop shop to get in contact with the viewers, understanding them,
and reacting accordingly.

As was mentioned this is a work-in-progress build and needs some tweaks to make it better.
This is by no shred of the imagination the final product. Currently, I am working on several 
known issues that I plan on working through. The plan currently is to get 3 things up and 
running before the next commit on this repo. 1) Exception handling on classes will be a #1
priority. 2) Working on getting the giveaway.cc file some much needed finishing with database 
creation inside the program being one of my top priorities. 3) Working on adding and deprecating
some of the class variables and methods to help streamline the usages of the program.

Any suggestions are always welcome and if you would like to use it while I work on it, download the
files (Viewer.h, Viewer.cc, Prize.cc, Prize.h, and Makefile) and put it in your /include directory. 

Again, any support would be great, this is the culmination of my time as a CSCI major so any comments,
suggestions, or questions are welcome. Thank you!
